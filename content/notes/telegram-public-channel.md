You can actually view any public Telegram channel without requiring a Telegram account. All you need to do is follow this pattern `t.me/s/<channel-name>` to the Telegram channel URL. This is why you can view [Daily Dad Jokes](https://t.me/s/DailyDadJokes) and [BBC Earth Daily](https://t.me/s/BBCEarthDaily) outside of Telegram. Even my [personal public channel](https://t.me/s/jesstern) is made available this way.
