Let's say we want to create a list of numbers from [0..9]. How would we do this in JavaScript

A simple approach would be to use a `for` loop

```js
const numbers = []

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  numbers.push(i)
}

// [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

Another approach is to use the `Array.prototype.keys()` method which returns the index of each element


```js
const numbers = [...Array(10).keys()]
// [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

Perhaps the most elegant solution is to use `Array.from()`

```js
const numbers = Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => i)
// [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

`Array.from()` takes an array-like object as its first argument and a map function that will be applied to each element. In this case, we pass an object with a `length` property and then we take just return the index from the map function. 

If we wanted to start our list at 1 instead, then we can do this

```js
Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => i + 1) 
// [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ]
```

Or, more generally, if we wanted include 10 numbers starting from a certain numbers

```js
const startingNumber = 3

Array.from({length: 10}, (_, i) => i + startingNumber)
// [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ]
```
