Bike shedding also known as Parkinson’s Law of Triviality occurs when members of a team give disproportionate weight to trivial issues when bigger issues are up for discussion.

The term bike shedding came about through Parkinson's fictional story of a committee who had to approve plans for a nuclear power plant, but preferred to discuss about a bike shed instead because the problem was easier to grasp.
