I came across this [article](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/5a9909939e6ce7d09e29) arguing why we should not use VPN services. The idea that VPN services could be malicious or a honeypot is a legitimate concern. 

Their suggestion is to set up your own VPN instead with [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) or [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/).
