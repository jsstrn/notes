It is often recommended to install updates before installing other packages, we can create a Cron job that will run these commands on a daily basis.

List existing Cron jobs

```sh
crontab -l
```

Create a new Cron job

```sh
crontab -e
```

Now add this line to the `crontab` which will run daily at midnight

```sh
0 0 * * * sudo apt update && sudo apt --yes upgrade
```
