There are three main types of switches to choose from â€“ linear, tactile, and clicky. The most popular switches are made by Cherry MX which have assigned red for linear switches, brown for tactile swithces, and blue for clicky switches.

Brown switches are the most suitable ones for most users. They require a bit more force to active the keys and therefore reduce accidental typos. This is my preferred option.

Blue switches are similar to brown swithces but emit an audible click sound when pressed. This may not be suitable when working in an office space.

Red switches, because they are linear, have no feedback when pressed and are more suitable for gamers. Accidentally hitting a key will activate it, this results in more typos, but is acceptable for gaming.
