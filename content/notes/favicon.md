I like creating my own favicons with [John Sorrentino](https://twitter.com/johnsorrentino)'s [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). The tool allows you to convert existing images into `.ico` file format or create a simple favicon from text or emoji. 

Another useful resource is [Icon Archive](https://www.iconarchive.com/). They offer beautifully designed icons that can be downloaded in various formats including, `.ico`.
