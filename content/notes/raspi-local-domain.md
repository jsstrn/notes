First, install [Avahi](https://www.avahi.org/) on your Raspberry Pi

```sh
sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon
```

Now you can access your Raspberry Pi via its hostname `raspberrypi.local` instead of its IP address. You can also change the hostname (see reference).

```sh
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```
