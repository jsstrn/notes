This is not a blog.

These notes are written for myself as a reference and mostly center around software development, but may occasionally include other topics. They are deliberately concise. Think of it as a brain archive similar to Josh Branchaud's [Today I Learned](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

These notes are organized by [tags](/tags/) and [categories](/categories/), and can be viewed in its entirety in [one page](/notes/). They are written in Markdown, built into a static site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
