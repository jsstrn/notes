This is not a blog. 

These notes are written for myself as a reference and mostly center around software development, but may occasionally include other topics. Think of it as a brain archive similar to Josh Branchaud's [til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til).

These notes are written in Markdown, built into a site with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and then hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
