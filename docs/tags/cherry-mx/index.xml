      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are three main types of switches to choose from â€“ linear, tactile, and clicky. The most popular switches are made by Cherry MX which have assigned red for linear switches, brown for tactile swithces, and blue for clicky switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown switches are the most suitable ones for most users. They require a bit more force to active the keys and therefore reduce accidental typos. This is my preferred option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blue switches are similar to brown swithces but emit an audible click sound when pressed. This may not be suitable when working in an office space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red switches, because they are linear, have no feedback when pressed and are more suitable for gamers. Accidentally hitting a key will activate it, this results in more typos, but is acceptable for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
